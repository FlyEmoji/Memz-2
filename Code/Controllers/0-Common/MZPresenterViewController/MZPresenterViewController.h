/* Presenter View Controller implements reusable code and behavior to present other View Controllers with custom 
 * transitions. It can be seen as a main View Controller that will always be responsible for initiating new flows /
 * controllers. Its shared transitionBehavior can notably be used every time a MZPresentableViewController is
 * presented in order to enjoy its already implemented transitioning behavior.
