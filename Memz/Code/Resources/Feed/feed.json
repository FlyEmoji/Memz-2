	"body": "SYDNEY, Australia — On the menu that comes to the table at the end of the meal, it is described simply as “abalone schnitzel and bush condiments.\n\nBut those words don’t really do justice to the delicious eccentricity of the dish, part of a 10-week pop-up being staged here, through April 2, by the team from Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant famed for foraging indigenous ingredients and weaving them into a new kind of contemporary cuisine.\n\n Looking like a Seder plate from one of Saturn’s moons, the schnitzel dish involves a tender, crispy-battered half-disk of abalone surrounded by an orbiting green array of native Australian delights, a few of which are obscure enough that most Australians would never consider eating them.\n\n There’s Neptune’s necklace, a seaweed whose briny pods pop in your mouth, and finger lime, whose minuscule capsules offer a contrasting squirt of tart citrus. There’s mat-rush, which grows along the coast and looks like a leek. There’s even a bunya nut, which may have been a favorite snack among the dinosaurs, and another nugget from a rain forest tree called the Atherton oak.",

	"body": "With their spotted coats and black “teardrop” facial markings, cheetahs are a favorite of tourists on photographic safaris. The animals race across the African savanna at speeds close to 60 miles per hour because of their unique physiology: elongated legs, aerodynamic skull, enlarged adrenal glands and heart muscles, and claws that grip the earth like football cleats. Considered critically endangered, cheetahs number only about 10,000 today, with most living in southern and eastern Africa.\n\n What the genomic analysis reveals is not encouraging: The cheetah has less than 5 percent of the genomic diversity of other wild cats, a level much lower than even inbred domestic dogs and cats and the lowest among the 30 mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. Genetic diversity in an animal is determined by variation in enzyme genes inherited by an animal’s two parents and is critical to its healthy reproduction and immunity to disease.",

	"body": "I’ve watched hundreds of movies over the years to help me to learn one language or another.\n\nI bet you have too. Who doesn’t like a good movie? And even better if it’s in your target language!\n\n The thing is, I don’t do it much any more.\n\n At a certain point, I grew a bit suspicious of that stock language-learning advice that every man in the street will give you: Oh, you want to learn [language in question]? Well, you should watch movies! You’ll get to hear how people really speak!\n\nI think I’ve got a fairly good perspective on this topic, having watched a lot of movies in numerous languages, and, importantly, at different stages of proficiency in those languages. Whether you can learn a language from watching foreign films is a question that Anne Billson posed recently in an article for The Telegraph, and actually suggested a few good ideas, but ended the article without drawing any clear conclusions.\n\nIn the last 6 months, whilst learning Cantonese, I’ve had the opportunity to take a fresh look at the role movies actually play in my learning, from the zero beginner level onwards. This little project changed my perspective about the role of movies in language learning for beginners.\n\nBy the end of this post, you will have a much clearer idea of the true benefits of watching movies in a foreign language. (Warning – it’s probably not what you’re expecting!)\n\nYou’ll be able to make a more informed decision about how much of your time you spend in front of the TV screen, and what I think you should be doing instead.\n\nI’ll also give you 10 ways to really make the most out of the movies you do watch, and make sure you’re not wasting your time!",

	"body": "In addition, the sequencing of the genome illuminated gene mutations that probably explain the sperm abnormalities seen in all cheetahs today. Gene AKAP4, known to regulate sperm development in humans, showed remarkable signatures of natural selection because of 10 mutations, five of them likely to block normal sperm development.\n\nBut what makes the cheetah run? For this function, natural selection was on the animal’s side. Eleven different genes showed evidence of mutations occurring over generations that boosted the animal’s muscle contraction, stress response and regulation of energy-releasing processes, all of which beefed up the big cat’s running prowess.",
